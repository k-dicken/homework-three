        <h1>CAMEO 4</h2>
        <p>
            With more speed and power than any other Silhouette machine, the Cameo 4 is a desktop cutting machine for the modern maker.  
            <br>
            With certain materials you can now choose to cut from a mat or go completely matless using Cameo 4’s smart cutting technology. You can also cut directly from a roll using the built-in roll feeder and crosscutter. Cut out or sketch on dozens of materials such as vinyl, cardstock, fabric, and more.
